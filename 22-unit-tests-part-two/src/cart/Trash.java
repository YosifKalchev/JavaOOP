    1. Milk Chocolate
Milk chocolate is typically produced from dark chocolate with low levels of cocoa but high levels of sugar,
and a milk product that can be boiled milk, milk powder, or condensed milk. As compared to dark chocolate,
milk chocolate has a lighter and sweeter taste.

2. Dark Chocolate
Also known as unsweetened chocolate, dark chocolate lacks milk or milk solids and therefore has a dry,
bitter aftertaste. Regardless of its bitter flavor, 35% of the world’s population prefers dark chocolate over
other kinds of chocolate. The basic ingredients of dark chocolate bars include cacao beans, soy lecithin, sugar,
 and flavorings like vanilla.

3. Couverture Chocolate
Couverture refers to the highest quality of chocolate that is made from basic chocolate ingredients including
 cocoa solids, cocoa butter, sugar, and additives like milk powder, soy lecithin, and vanilla. Unlike regular
 chocolate, couverture chocolate has the finest texture and that’s because of the addition of cocoa butter in
  the highest amount. Because of this, both the texture and flavor of couverture chocolate is supreme


4. Compound Chocolate
Compound chocolate is a type of chocolate that is made from a mixture of cocoa, vegetable fats, and sweeteners.
It is a cheaper alternative to regular chocolate since it uses low-cost vegetable fats like palm oil or coconut
oil instead of costly cocoa butter.

5. White Chocolate
The ingredient that lends a luscious brown color to typical chocolate is the cocoa powder, which is absent from
the making of white chocolate. This is precisely why white chocolate lacks an intense, dark color atypical of
other kinds of chocolate. The main ingredient of white chocolate is cocoa butter that is mixed with milk solids,
milk fat, lecithin, and sugar to hold it well together.

6. Ruby Chocolate
After dark, white, and milk chocolate, ruby is considered as the fourth type of chocolate that is famous for
 its pretty pink color. Ruby chocolate is comparatively newer and was first officially unveiled by
 Belgian-Swiss cocoa company – Barry Callebaut – in 2017

1. Fuji
On the sweeter side, Fuji apples are a relative to red delicious apples and make a great flavor enhancer.
 They have a more mild flavor, so they are great in dishes that need a little something extra without overpowering
  the other ingredients. They are best raw, in salads or slaws or sauces.

2. Honeycrisp
This super crisp apple has just the right balance of sweet, tart, and juicy flesh, an autumn favorite that is
high in demand. The skin is blush red with undertones of green. They require tempering at a mild temperature
before refrigerating by producers, which tends to drive the price higher. The juice is often used to make apple cider.
 It cooks up nicely and holds its shape in desserts, savory dishes, or can be pureed for sauces

3.Envy
Envy apples are very round and ruby red. You may see a little green near the stem. They are tough, so you’ll get a
good crunch when you take a bite. But what about taste? These apples lean toward to sweet end of the spectrum

4.Gala
Gala apples are taller, thinner, and less wise than other apples. They are a light red color with more yellow on
their skin than other red varieties, and they taste mildly sweet and crisp. That flavor is not intense, but they
 still make great cooking and baking companions

5.Pazazz
Pazazz apples sort of look like someone tie-died their skin yellow and red (you might say they have pazazz).
Flavor-wise, they are often compared to an enhanced Honeycrisp apple — mostly sweet with a touch of tartness

6. Braeburn
You may not see these as often, native to New Zealand. Braeburn apples have a dim, red skin (similar to gala apples),
 and their texture is firm and crisp. Each bite has a nice balance of sweet and tart, and they’re best for baking or
 eating raw
